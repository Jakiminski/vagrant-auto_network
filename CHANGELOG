vagrant-auto_network
====================

1.0.1
-----

2014-06-06

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * (GH-23) Fix crashes occurring when a VM has a pre-allocated AutoNetwork IP
    address.

  * Fix errors raised when a machine exists in the `.vagrant` directory
    but no longer has a config in the `Vagrantfile`.


1.0.0
-----

2014-05-21

This is a mostly-backwards compatible feature release.

For this release, serialization format has been completely re-written to add
support for multiple providers and to better manage global state and guard
against race conditions. Care has been taken to support existing AutoNetwork
environments, but it is possible that some breakage will occur.

Specifically, the following issues have been addressed:

  * (GH-12) Support for more than just the VirtualBox provider. The
		implementation has been tested against the VMware Fusion provider but
		should be general enough to support other providers as well.

  * (GH-2) The infamous `0.0.0.0` hack is no longer necessary when using
	  AutoNetwork.

  * (GH-6) The IP address pools managed by AutoNetwork are now backed by a
	  storage mechanism that offers more resiliance to race conditions and data
		loss from aborted actions.

The following features have been removed:

	* (GH-14) Remove depreciated AutoNetwork mixin module.
