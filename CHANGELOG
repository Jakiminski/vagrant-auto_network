vagrant-auto_network
====================

0.2.0
-----

2013-08-07

This is a backwards compatible feature release. It reimplements the
auto_network functionality as part of the :private_network network config
method. It also implements persistent leases so that machines in different
Vagrant environments all have unique addresses.
