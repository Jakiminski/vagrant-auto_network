    pool_exhausted: |-
      The machine '%{name}' tried to get an automatic network address, but all
      ip addresses in the network range '%{network}' have been used. This is
      probably due to VMs being deleted outside of Vagrant. Check the
      auto_network pool configuration file and remove the machine IDs from
      addresses that are no longer in use, or add addresses to the pool.

    invalid_setting: |-
      The following value is not a valid setting for '%{setting_name}': '%{value}'
